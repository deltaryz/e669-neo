# e669

This is an experimental alternate client/browser intended to improve upon the limitations and design flaws of [e621](https://e621.net) and [Derpibooru](https://derpibooru.org/)'s standard browsing experience.

The primary purpose is to create a smoother and more flexible interface for browsing these sites and their content, minimizing the amount of extra clicks and actions needed to effectively navigate the website. The user experience should be mobile-friendly and entirely usable with one hand.

It is currently a work in progress and many planned features are not yet implemented.

This is a ground-up rewrite of the original e669, available [here](https://github.com/techniponi/e669).
